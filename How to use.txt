hey carlos this is the fmcsa scrapper and this is how to use it.

1 - you need to run the chromedriver and it needs to stay up in the background
2 - you need to tell the scrapper how many pages to scrape 
you will find code line 14 like this 
pagestoscrape = 0
you just change the 0 to the number of pages you want to scrape 
3- run the scrapper and wait for it 
4- once it's done you will fina a csv file calle Data_output.csv in the scrapper folder
